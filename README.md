# SWEN90007_Project - Realestate
### **Project Description**
---
In this project, we are aiming to build a web-based and enterprise-scale property resource application which connects real estate agents with highly engaged and informed consumers right across the buying and renting cycle. Properties on this platform include residential and commercial properties. The application serves as a way that real estate agents can publish housing estates on it for sale or rent. Meanwhile, it provides a centralized resource platform where consumers can seek for properties to buy or rent and book inspections for ones they like.
This system has sufficient complex business logic for two main reasons. First, there are two main roles involved in this system including real estate agency and customer. Meanwhile, each real estate agency may have multiple individual agents working in that company and each agent may have a different set of property resources he or she is particularly responsible for. Secondly, in addition to publishing resources and seeking for properties, customers and agents can interact and communicate with each other via the platform. For instance, a customer can submit an enquiry regarding a particular apartment to the agent who is in charge of that property.
