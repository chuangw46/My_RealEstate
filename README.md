### **Project Description**
---
In this project, we are aiming to build a web-based and enterprise-scale property resource application which connects real estate agents with highly engaged and informed consumers right across the buying and renting cycle. Properties on this platform include residential and commercial properties. \
The application serves as a way that real estate agents can publish housing estates on it for sale or rent. Meanwhile, it provides a centralized resource platform where consumers can seek for properties to buy or rent and book inspections for ones they like.\
This project is done by [Chuang Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuangw/) and [Junhan Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junhan-yang-269213190/)

1. By using the platform, registered real estate agents can publish housing estates on it for sale or rent. Use cases are described as following
    - account registration
    - **C** publishing properties for either sale or rent

    - **U** updating their personal profile & updating property information i.e price, inspection date etc.
    - **D** removing a property from the platform if the property is not availbale anymore

2. Users registered as ‘customers’ are able to look for properties that are currently available for renting or selling. To be more specific, use cases for a customer are described as following

    - **R** searching properties based on filters under the search bar including price range, room size, location and real estate agencies, searching agents based on names under the agent search bar, looking into detailed information about properties or agents.
